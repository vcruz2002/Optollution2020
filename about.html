            <P><b>Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Victor Cruz:</b>"I was born in San Pablo California and lived in Richmond, CA my whole life. I lived near a Cheveron Refinery my whole life and am saddened that I am barely learning about the dangers that exist. In 2010, the Cheveron Refinery brockdown and polluted the air. The whole city was  stuck in their homes and were scared. Richmond's population is mostly colored people and almost everyone in North Richmond is low income and colored. I chose to team up with Optollution because I believe it pollution is segregated and that is unfair" </P>
