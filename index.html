            Optollution is an interactive app add-on that displays important information about air quality in your area. The name “Optollution” conveys the fact that the app lets you see clouds, fog, and rain in your area as well as air pollutants that are usually invisible. Optollution is designed to be a mandatory add-on to the Weather App installed on all smartphones. When you open Optollution, you see your current location layed out in a map-like style. You can then navigate around using your fingers, passing colored-representations of air toxins as you scroll on! In addition to the interactive GPS feature, Optollution also allows you to view a static page, similar in design to Weather functions on phones. This page allows you to see different predicted air-toxicity reports for the different days in the week. 
	Because this app is connected to the Weather App in your smartphone, it has the ability to send you (and everyone in your community) a warning notification when air pollution in your area reaches a dangerous level. This warning feature helps an area leave an affected-area before any residents are affected by the contamination.
